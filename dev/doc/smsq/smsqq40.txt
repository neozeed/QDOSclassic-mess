Introduction
From the point of view of the hardware dependent features, SMSQ/E as implemented on the Q40 is very similar to other SMSQ implementations. The only significant differences are minor improvements.
The hard disk and floppy disk drivers can handle multiple disk formats, two floppy disk drives and four hard disk drives. Two IO cards can be used to provide up to 4 serial ports and 3 parallel printer ports.
Machine Type
The two standard functions to determine the machine type are, of course, supported.
MACHINE
The MACHINE function returns the machine type. This function returns 17 for the standard Q40.
PROCESSOR
The PROCESSOR function returns the 680x0 family member - 40 for the Q40.
Memory Protection
All production Q40s include a memory management unit but this is not yet fully used by SMSQ/E. The PROT_MEM procedure has, therefore, no effect in current versions and the supervisor mode access peeks and pokes do not have any different effect from there user mode cousins.
PROT_MEM
The PROT_MEM (level) procedure sets the level of the memory protection. This is ignored in current versions.
POKES POKES_W POKES_L
POKES (address, value) POKES_W (address, value) and POKES_L (address, value) are the "supervisor mode" equivalents of POKE, POKE_W and POKE_L. By operating in supervisor mode they enable data to be written to the QL IO hardware. Do not be surprised if your computer self-destructs when you use them.
PEEKS PEEKS_W PEEKS_L
PEEKS (address) PEEKS_W (address) and PEEKS_L (address) are the "supervisor mode" equivalents of PEEK, PEEK_W and PEEK_L. By operating in supervisor mode they enable data to be written to the QL IO hardware. Do not be surprised if your computer self-destructs when you use them.
Q40 Display
DISP_TYPE
The DISP_TYPE function is used to find the type of display. For the Q40, there are two values that may be returned.
0	Original ST QL emulator (this value is returned on QL based hardware).
1	16 bit colour mode.
ncol = 4						Assume 4 colour display
if DISP_TYPE = 1: ncol = 65536	If it is 16 bit the are 65536 colours
DISP_INVERSE
The DISP_INVERSE (0 or 1) command is used to invert a monochome display. It has no effect on the Q40.
DISP_SIZE
DISP_SIZE (xpixels, ylines) is used to set the display size. When a size greater than 512x256 is specified, 16 bit colour mode is selected (not implemented in this version).
DISP_SIZE 1024,512		change to 1024x512 16 bit colour mode.
DISP_RATE
DISP_RATE (frame rate, line rate) is used to specify the frame and line scan rates. It has no effect on the Q40
DISP_BLANK
DISP_BLANK (x blank, y blank) sets the size of the blank area to the sides of and above and below the image. It has no effect on the Q40
Mouse driver
The mouse driver checks serial ports 4, 3, 2 and 1, in that order, looking for a Microsoft compatible two or three button mouse. If a mouse is used, it should be plugged into the highest port number available.
Because current serial mice for the PC have a much higher resolution (the pointer moves faster) than older mice, the original pointer interface scheme (accelerating slow mice) is no longer adequate. The new MOUSE_SPEED command is used to define the "acceleration". The value specified for the MOUSE_SPEED is the same as the value that can be specified in the QPAC2 SYSDEF menu.
MOUSE_SPEED
MOUSE_SPEED (#channel, speed, wake) defines both a scaling for the mouse movement and an acceleration factor used for large movements.

Speed	Scaling	Acceleration	
0	1/8	low	
1	1/8	normal	
2	1/4	low	
3	1/4	normal	
4	1/2	low	
5	1/2	normal	
6	1	low	
7	1	normal	
8	1	high	
9	1	extreme	
The optional wake defines how far the mouse will need to move before the pointer will appear (waking up the pointer) in a text input window.
The channel is optional, if the default channel is available, and is a console, no channel need be specified.
MOUSE_SPEED 2						standard Microsoft mouse with low acceleration
MOUSE_SPEED #0,5,8					cheap mouse with acceleration,
									pointer reluctant to wake up
Speeds 7 to 9 are the same as for previous versions. Speeds 0 to 6 are all slower than in previous versions. If a "low acceleration" speed is chosen, the pointer movement may be slightly viscous (this is an advantage in some applications). The default mouse speed is 7 (old mouse with normal acceleration). This default is overwritten by a configurable speed when QPAC2 is loaded.
The default wake speed is 3 which is fairly sensitive. This default is overwritten by a configurable speed when QPAC2 is loaded.
MOUSE_STUFF
MOUSE_STUFF (#channel, string) defines a 0, 1 or 2 character string to be stuffed into the keyboard queue when the centre (or left and right) buttons are pressed. This is usually used to send a Hotkey. If a Hotkey is required, the first character should be CHR$(255).
ERT HOT_THING (".", "Button_Pick")		ALT . picks the button bar
MOUSE_STUFF CHR$(255) & "."			The middle mouse button picks the button bar
The default stuff string is CHR$(255) & ".". This default is overwritten by a configurable Hotkey when QPAC2 is loaded.
The channel is optional, if the default channel is available, and is a console, no channel need be specified.
Serial (RS232) Ports on the Q40
The serial ports correspond to the standard IBM COM ports. Note that, unlike the PC BIOS SMSQ does not attempt to renumber the ports if it finds that one or more are missing
SER1		COM1		address $3F8
SER2		COM2		address $2F8
SER3		COM1/3	address $3E8
SER4		COM2/4	address $2E8
The baud rates correspond to the normal PC baud rates: standard rates up to 38400 baud and then 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800 and 921600 baud. Only 16550A/16450 compatible serial ports are supported (i.e. any IO card made in the past few years). The availability of rates above 115200 depends on whether the IO card supports these rates and whether the mechanism to produce these rates is recognised by the drivers.
BAUD 2,38400			. . . sets SER2 to 38400 baud
BAUD 57600				. . . sets SER1 to 57600 baud
All the SMSQ/E standard serial port control commands are avail.
Parallel Printer Ports
The parallel printer ports correspond to the standard IBM LPT ports.
PAR1		LPT1/2	address $378
PAR2		LPT2/3	address $278
PAR3		LPT1/2/3	address $3BC
The standard parallel port driver assumes that the parallel port is IEEE 1284 compatible (ECP) and it will normally operate in SPP FIFO mode. The port can also operate in original PC mode. There are three reasons for operating in original PC mode.
1.Some IO cards are not compatible, in ECP mode, with the Q40 interrupt system. If possible, this problem should be resolved by removing the IRQ7/IRQ5 jumper so that the card does not produce parallel port interrupts at all. It may, however, be necessary to set the jumpers on the card to SPP (original PC) mode.
2.Some printers may require a longer strobe pulse than is provided in FIFO mode.
3.It is PAR3 which is the LPT port at address $3BC. This is not an ECP port address.
PAR_PULSE
PAR_PULSE (port, pulse length) sets the notional strobe pulse length in ISA bus cycles. If the port is not specified, PAR1 is assumed. If the pulse length is zero, then the parallel printer port will operate in FIFO mode. If it is greater than 0, then the parallel printer port will operate in original PC mode.
PAR_PULSE 2,2			drive an old Epson printer on PAR2
PAR_PULSE 0			. . . set PAR 1 to FIFO mode
FIFO mode should be used if possible. The default value for PAR_PULSE is 0 if the IO card is configured for ECP mode or 1 if the IO card is configured for SPP mode.
PAR_WAIT
PAR_WAIT (port, wait cycles) sets the length of time that the parallel port drive will wait for the printer to be ready before it gives up and lets the Q40 do something else. This has no effect in FIFO mode, but in original PC mode it allows the buffer in the printer to be stuffed in bursts. The default value is 0. The larger the value, the higher the probability that a more than one byte of data can be sent on each interrupt, but the higher the load on the machine.
If the IO card does not provide IRQ7 and the machine is busy, PAR_PULSE with have a much greater effect than if IRQ7 is used and/or the machine is idle.
PAR_WAIT 2,20			give the printer on PAR2 a high priority.
PAR_WAIT 0				. . . set PAR 1 use the minimum of processor time.
For an Epson Stylus COLOR Pro printer, PAR_PAUSE 10 and PAR_PAUSE 50 improved the transfer speed by 30% on an idle machine: the rate was primarily determined by the printer. On a busy machine with no interrupts, PAR_PAUSE 10 improved the transfer speed by a factor of 3 and PAR_PAUSE 50 improved the transfer speed by a factor of 5. The speed of other tasks in the machine was reduced.
Q40 Hard Disks
IDE drives
The current IDE driver does not support removable drives.
WIN Drive Numbers and Name
ATA (IDE) drives are identified by the bus to which they are attached (primary or secondary), whether they are drive 0 or 1 on that bus (for historical reasons these are often called the master and slave drive although ATA compliant drives are neither master nor slaves: they are truly independent) and a partition on the drive.
Windows numbers its drives from C: as it finds them. This causes chaos if a removable media drive (or a normal drive in a rack) is used. (One of my PCs is obsessed by a phantom drive F: it thinks it is a 100kbyte CDROM).
SMSQ/E adopts a rather more cumbersome approach which is, however, much more precise. The initialisation code will attempt to find a file called "BOOT" on any partition on drive 0. WIN1 will be set to this partition. Thereafter, you must define your own WIN drives for any other drive and partition you wish to access.
This means that if, for example, you have a drive in a rack, the other drive numbers stay the same regardless of whether the drive is in or out when you boot the system.
SMSQ/E does not require the whole of a drive to be used for itself: the drive can be partitioned between different operating systems. Depending on the format of used by the other operating systems, SMSQ/E may be able to read or write these "foreign" partitions. Partitions are number from 0.
WIN_DRIVE
WIN_DRIVE (drive, target, unit, partition) is used to select a particular drive, unit and partition combination to be accessed using a particular WIN drive.
The "target" and "unit" notion comes from the SCSI bus terminology, the target is a physical device and the unit is a subdivision of that device. For IDE bus drives, there is only one unit per drive so the unit number is always zero and may be omitted. If the partition is omitted as well, then partition 0 (or the whole drive) is assumed.
	Target	Bus	Drive
	0	Primary	0 (Master)
	1	Primary	1 (Slave)
	2	Secondary	0 (Master)
	3	Secondary	1 (Slave)
Issuing a WIN_DRIVE command for a particular drive will cause the drive map to be re-read the next time the disk is accessed. It can, therefore, be used to force the drivers to recognise a disk change.
WIN_DRIVE 2,0,1		WIN2 is drive 0 on the primary bus, partition 1
WIN_DRIVE 3,3		WIN3 is drive 1 on the secondary bus (whole drive or partition 0)
WIN_DRIVE$
WIN_DRIVE$ is a function which returns a string giving the target, unit and partition used by a particular WIN drive.
WIN_DRIVE 2,0,1		WIN2 is drive 0 on the primary bus, partition 1
WIN_DRIVE 3,3		WIN3 is drive 1 on the secondary bus (whole drive or partition 0)
PRINT WIN_DRIVE$(2)		Prints 0,0,1
PRINT WIN_DRIVE$(3)		Prints 3,0,0
WIN_USE
WIN_USE may be used to set the name of the WIN device. The name should be 3 characters long and in upper or lower case.
WIN_USE MDV			The WIN device is renamed MDV
WIN_USE win			The WIN device is restored to WIN
WIN_USE				The WIN device is restored to WIN
Formatting WIN Drives
If a drive is unformatted (or not recognisably formatted) you can format the whole drive as an SMSQ drive.
WIN_FORMAT 1			Allow WIN drives to be formatted
WIN_DRIVE 3,2			Set WIN3 to secondary drive 0, whole drive
FORMAT win3_Fred		FORMAT WIN3
WIN_FORMAT 0			Prevent WIN drives from being formatted
On the other hand, if you wish to share a drive between different operating systems, you can partition the drive by executing the MKPART utility before formatting.
WIN_FORMAT 1			Allow WIN drives to be formatted
WIN_DRIVE 3,2,1			Set WIN3 to secondary drive 0, partition 1
EW MKPART				Partition drive, setting partition 1 to "QWA"
FORMAT win3_Fred		FORMAT WIN3
WIN_FORMAT 0			Prevent WIN drives from being formatted
WIN Control Commands
There are a number of "odd" WIN device control commands.
WIN_WP
WIN_WP (drive, 0 or 1) is used to software write protect a WIN drive.
WIN_WP 1,1				Set the "write protect" flag for the drive accessed by WIN1
WIN_WP 1,0				Clear the "write protect" flag for the drive accessed by WIN1
WIN_START
WIN_STOP
The WIN_START (drive) and WIN_STOP (drive, time) commands may be used to start and stop a drive. If a time is given on the WIN_STOP command, the drive should not stop immediately: the time is the period without any disk accesses that that must elapse before the drive automatically enters standby mode. A zero time cancels the automatic standby timer.
WIN_STOP 2				Stop the drive accessed by WIN2 now
WIN_STOP 2,3			Stop the drive accessed by WIN2 when there has been no
						access for 3 minutes
WIN_STOP 2,0			Do not stop the drive accessed by WIN2
WIN_START 2			Start the drive accessed by WIN2
Note that all the operations that might be used to restart a drive (there is no "official" ATA command) are "vendor specific": on your particular drive, the drive may not start again until you try and read from (or write to) the drive, or it may never start again. You should also note that, on some drives, WIN_STOP drive, time will not only set the timer but stop the drive immediately as well.
As with any ATA command, these commands will work if they work, otherwise they will not work.
Q40 Floppy Disks
The Q40 will normally have one or two HD disk drives The SMSQ/E FLP driver can read or write QL5A, QL5B and MSDOS format diskettes. It can format QL5A (DD) and QL5B (HD) format diskettes.
Floppy Disk Driver Name
The default name of the floppy disk driver is FLP. The internal drive is FLP1. The external drive (if any) is FLP2.
FLP_USE
FLP_USE may be used to set the name of the FLP device. The name should be 3 characters long and in upper or lower case.
FLP_USE mdv			The FLP device is renamed MDV
FLP_USE FLP			The FLP device is restored to FLP
FLP_USE				The FLP device is restored to FLP
Formatting Diskettes
The SMSQ/E FLP driver will usually format a diskette to the highest density it can. The density may, however, be set using the FLP_DENSITY command or by adding a special code to the end of the medium name in the format command.
FLP_DENSITY
The SMSQ/E format routines will usually attempt to format a disk to the highest density possible for a medium. The FLP_DENSITY (code) is used to specify a particular recording density during format.
The density codes are "S" for single sided (double density), "D" for double density and "H" for high density.
FLP_DENSITY S			Set the default format to single sided
FLP_DENSITY H			Set the default format to high density
FLP_DENSITY			Reset to automatic density selection
The same code letters may be added (after a *) to the end of the medium name to force a particular density format. (For compatibility with older drivers, if the code letter is omitted after the *, single sided format is assumed.
FORMAT 'FLP1_Disk23'	Format at highest density or as specified by FLP_DENSITY
FORMAT 'FLP1_Disk24*'	Format single sided
FORMAT 'FLP1_Disk25*S'	Format single sided
FORMAT 'FLP1_Disk25*D'	Format double sided, double density
FLP_TRACK
The FLP_TRACK (number of tracks) is used to limit the number of tracks formatted.
FLP_TRACK 23			Only format 23 tracks
FLP Control Commands
FLP_SEC
FLP_SEC (level) was used to set the security level. The security of the data stored on the diskettes can be seriously compromised if you change diskettes while there are files open. The security level affects the amount of time the FLP driver spends maintaining the data on the diskette up to date with the internal copies of the data in memory. In principle, a lower level is more efficient, but more risky. With the increasing use of hard disks, the security level of the FLP has been fixed at level 2: the most secure. FLP_SEC is ignored.
FLP_START
The FLP_START (ticks) command specifies the number of ticks (1/50th of a second) that the FLP driver waits after starting the drive before writing to it. This allows the diskette to get up to speed before the write operation. The default value is 24, which is a wait of about 0.5 s. There should not be any reason to use this command.
FLP_STEP
The FLP_STEP (drive, step) command specifies the step rate for a particular drive. If the drive number is omitted, the step rate applies to both drives. The step rate will be adjusted downwards by the driver if there are repeated seek errors. The FLP_STEP command should not, therefore, be necessary.
FLP_STEP 2,15			Set FLP2 to 15 ms step rate
FLP_STEP 3				Set both drives to 3 ms step rate.
Sampled Sound System
The SMSQ/E sampled sound system for the Q40 assumes that a sampling rate of 20 kHz will always be used.
The system is based on a 2 byte wide queue. Sound generators should stuff pairs of bytes (left, right) in the queue. The queue is 200 kilobytes long which allows up to 5 seconds free running. A normal "boing" can be set up in a single operation.
The SMSQ/E sampled sound system provides four basic functions to add a single sample, to add an arbitrary number of samples, to stop the sound and to estimate the length of sound samples remaining in the queue.
The SMSQ/E sampled sound system should be accessed in supervisor mode (in principal, this will be a sound device driver) via the interrupt level 4 auto vector.
	move.l	$70,a3			interrupt level 4 auto vector
	move.l	-(a3),a2			address of sample sound system functions
	cmp.l	#'SSSS',-(a3)		SMSQ/E Sampled Sound System
	bne.s	oops
…	jsr		$04(a2)			add a sample
…	jsr		$08(a2)			set up to add multiple samples
…	jsr		$0c(a2)			notify that multiple samples have been added
…	jsr		$10(a2)			kill the sound
SSS_ADD1 ($04)
The sss_add1 call is used to add one sample to the sound queue. To limit the overheads, it does not save any registers.
D1	call byte		left hand sound level
D2	call byte		right hand sound level
A1	smashed
A3	call			pointer to 'SSSS' flag (see code above)
The sound level is a byte value between 0 and 255. The sound "zero" level is 128. This should be the last value written to the left and right hand sound queues.
This call does not have a standard error return. It returns status Z if the operation sample has not been added because the queue is full.
SSS_SETM ($08)
The sss_setm call sets up to add multiple samples to the sound queue.
A1	return		the pointer to the next free byte pair in the queue
A2	return		the pointer past the last free byte pair in the queue
A3	call			pointer to 'SSSS' flag (see code above)
The calling routine can fill the area from a1 to a2 with pairs of bytes. It does not, however, need to fill the whole of the area. When it has put samples into the queue, it should call SSS_ADDM to notify the sampled sound system.
SSS_ADDM ($0C)
The sss_addm call notifies that samples have been added to the sound queue.
A1	call			the updated pointer to the next free byte pair in the queue
A3	call			pointer to 'SSSS' flag (see code above)

	move.l	$70,a3					interrupt level 4 auto vector
	move.l	-(a3),a2					address of sample sound system functions
	cmp.l	#'SSSS',-(a3)				SMSQ/E Sampled Sound System
	bne.s	oops
	jsr		sss_setm(a2)				set up
	bra.s	end_loop
loop
	calculate next sample in d1.b, d2.b
	move.b	d1,(a1)+					add left sample
	move.b	d2,(a1)+					add right sample
end_loop
	cmp.l	a2,a1					more samples to do?
	blt.s		loop
	jsr		sss_addm(a2)				notify sampled sound system
SSS_KILL ($10)
The sss_kill call stops the sound system and throws the queue away.
A3	call			pointer to 'SSSS' flag (see code above)
SSS_SAMPLE ($14)
The sss_sample call estimates the number of samples remaining in the queue. This figure should be divided by 400 to give the length of the sound in ticks or divided by 20000 to give the length of sound in seconds.
D0	return long	number of samples remaining in queue
A3	call			pointer to 'SSSS' flag (see code above)
