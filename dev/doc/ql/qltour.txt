The Sinclair QL is a black slab-like computer based around Motorola's
68008 micro-processor. The QL was launched as the follow-up to the
ZX Spectrum, aimed at the business market rather than the games market
and was supplied with wordprocessor, spreadsheet, database and charting
programs. It features a fully multi-tasking operating system (QDOS)
and a very good built-in BASIC. The QL failed to achieve the mass-market
appeal of its predecessor, but nevertheless attracted a large dedicated
user base... which is still going strong.

A QUICK TOUR OF THE QL

When you first switch on a QL (or when you run the emulator) you are
presented with a screen requiring you to press F1 or F2.

On an actual QL, pressing F2 initialises the 3 standard windows (BASICs
#0, #1 and #2) such that they do not lie off the side of the screen when
viewed on a PAL TV. Since the video on the Amiga is very much compressed
relative to the QL, it is always best to choose the monitor setting - F1,
on the emulator.

Upon pressing F1 or F2, the system will attempt to load and run a file
called 'BOOT' from the disk inserted in the internal drive (FLP1_). With
the QDOS QLutils: disk inserted, a BASIC BOOT program will run that loads
a number of toolkits and installs a small RAM disk.

In any case, you will eventually be presented with a flashing cursor. This
is your bog-standard home-computer flashing-cursor, waiting for a NEW
program to be typed-in and RUN, or LOADed from floppy disk.

   For example, if you type in the following:

        NEW
        10 PRINT "Hello World!"
        RUN

   ...the words 'Hello World!' are printed on screen.
   If you add the following:

        20 GOTO 10
        RUN

   ...then the same words will be repeatedly printed until you BREAK the
   program with the keys <CTRL><SPACE>.

   You can save the program to the disk in the internal drive with the
   command:

        SAVE FLP1_HELLOWORLD_bas

   or, if there is no room on disk, you can FORMAT a new disk with the
   command:

        FORMAT FLP1_WORKDISK

   ...which formats the disk in the internal drive and gives it the name
   'WORKDISK'. Remember there is no going back once a disk is formatted.

   To list the contents of the internal floppy drive type:

        DIR FLP1_

   Loading a BASIC program from floppy disk is a simple matter:

        LOAD FLP1_PLAYMUSIC_bas

   You can then type:

        LIST

   ...to see the BASIC listing, or:

        RUN

   ...to execute the BASIC program.

   To execute a machine code task, use the EXEC_W keyword.
   For example:

        EXEC_W FLP1_XCHANGE

   ...will load and execute the stated program from the disk in the
   internal drive. At the same time it will suspend BASIC ( _W = wait ).
   To multi-task, use EXEC and press CTRL-C to task switch.
