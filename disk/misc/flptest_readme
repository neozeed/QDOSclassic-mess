Short:    exhaustive test of floppy disk driver
Author:   Mark J Swift
Version:  1.00
Uploader: msw@blackpool.ac.uk
Type:     misc

This program continuously and randomly moves the contents
of FLP1_ backwards and forwards between FLP1_ and RAM1_.
If it moves a file to RAM1_ it deletes it from FLP1_.
If it moves a file to FLP1_ it deletes it from RAM1_.
Thus the directory of FLP1_ is shuffled, and given enough time
the disk in FLP1_ will become extremely fragmented.

Pressing a key exits the program.

Used as an exhaustive test of the floppy disk driver.
If after 30 mins the driver hasn't failed, then you can
be pretty sure that your floppy driver is bug-free.
