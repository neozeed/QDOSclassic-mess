This is the system ROM that was originally shipped
to developers on early Q40 boards.

It allows you to test various bits of hardware
via the following on-screen menu:

  1 ROM Download
  2 Serial Ports
  3 Screen
  4 Keyboard
  5 Clock
  6 Sound
  7 Cache/Memory/Interrupt
  8 Harddisk
  9 Parallel Port


HOW TO LOAD THE ROM on SMSQ/E systems

  Firstly, load the SOFTROM toolkit with the following command:

  LRESPR SOFTROM_rext

This toolkit adds a single keyword - SOFTROM - to BASIC.
The SOFTROM keyword allows ROM images to be loaded into the ROM
area on the Q40 computer.

  Now, type:

  SOFTROM Q40util_ROM

This will load the utility ROM into the system ROM area.
The machine will then reboot.


HOW TO LOAD THE ROM on QDOS Classic systems

  Type:

  SOFTROM Q40util_ROM

This will load the utility ROM into the system ROM area.
The machine will then reboot.
