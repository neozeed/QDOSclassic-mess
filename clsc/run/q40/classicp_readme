Short:    The current QDOS CLASSIC ROM for the Q40
Author:   Mark J Swift
Version:  3.25 (beta p)
Uploader: msw@blackpool.ac.uk
Type:     clsc/run/q40


This is the most recent QDOS CLASSIC ROM for the Q40.


HOW TO LOAD THE ROM on SMSQ/E systems

  Firstly, load the SOFTROM toolkit with the following command:

  LRESPR SOFTROM_rext

This toolkit adds a single keyword - SOFTROM - to BASIC.
The SOFTROM keyword allows ROM images to be loaded into the system ROM
area on the Q40 computer. A hard reset will re-enable the real ROM.

  Now, type:

  SOFTROM CLASSICp_ROM

This will load QDOS Classic into the system ROM area.
The machine will then reboot.

PATCHING TK2 INTO THE ROM

Note TK2 is NOT included in this archive.

If you have a legal/spare version of TK2 you should
first, save it to disk (from a real QL) as follows:

  SBYTES flp1_TK2_ROM,16384*INT(WHERE("TK2_ext")/16384),16384

  (This requires the PD toolkit: PDTK_rext)

then, patch it into the CLASSIC ROM as follows:

  a=ALCHP(98304)
  LBYTES flp1_CLASSICp_ROM,a
  LBYTES flp1_TK2_ROM,a+49152
  SBYTES flp1_CLASSICp_ROM,a,98304
  RECHP(a)

HISTORY

BETA p

* Implemented BEEP command (all possible convolutions)
* Peripheral ROM sources changed to compile with GST asembler
  (BASIC make file included)
* Removed THINGs. QPAC2 no longer needs a special BOOT program for
  QDOS classic. You should be able to use your old QL one.
* Minimised patch-code delay.
  Explanation: The main system ROM does not know about the hardware, so
  it is necessary for the external ROMs to patch into the system vectors.
  BOOTSTRAP patches the LVL2 int vector and redirects other ints through
  the LVL2 code which distinguishes between FRAME and EXTERNAL ints.
  CLOCK patches into TRAP1 for MT.RCLCK, MT.SCLCK & MT.ACLCK
  KEYBOARD patches into TRAP1 for MT.IPCOM
  SERIAL patches into TRAP1 for MT.BAUD
  SAMPLED SOUND SYSTEM patches into the LVL4 & LVL6 int vectors
  All this Redirection adds to the time it takes to process these vectors,
  this delay has been minimised as much as possible in this version.

BETA o

* Implemented SER2.
* Implemented FLP2.
* Implemented an SMSQ/E compatible Sampled Sound System

BETA n

* Fixed bug in direct sector read/write (e.g. Flp1_*D<n><d>)
* Tidied up SOFTROM code. Created SOFTROM_rext toolkit for
  Q40 systems that lack QDOS Classic.

BETA m

* Fixed bug in memory check. 4mb & 20mb systems now work.
* F1 chosen automatically from F1/F2 screen if no key is
  pressed within 10 seconds.
* QubIDE times out properly if no hard drive h/w is present.

BETA l

* Fixed bug where some function keys didn't work.
* Added some rudimentary support for sound.

BETA k

* Fix to take account of PTR_GENs bad manners.
  PTR_GEN/WMAN combination now work.
* Some changes to allow QPAC2 to run, see QPAC2_boot and
  QPAC2_readme for example.
* Fixed bug in BREAK (<CTRL><SPACE>) that occasionally showed
  junk on screen.
* Fixed bug in SOFTROM that always showed junk on screen.
* <ALT><cursor key(s)> now repeats properly.
* Keyboard buffer is emptied at boot-time (hence slight delay)
  to fix some KEYROW problems from junk keystrokes.
* SERial now uses 2 stop bits for compatibility with QL (oops)
* By request, location $280a7 holds $11 to signify Q40 hardware
* Some documentation at last (see CLASSIC.txt)


THINGS TO DO

* Implement PAR
* Think up a good use for the NVR ram
