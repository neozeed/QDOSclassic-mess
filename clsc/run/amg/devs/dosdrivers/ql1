/* QL file system entry
 *
 * This file enables reading and writing of QDOS (QL) disks on the built-in
 * floppy drive normally referred to as DF1:. QL0 does the same for DF0. By
 * creating new versions of this file and changing the Unit line to use other
 * numbers, you can make the QLFileSystem available on other devices. For
 * example, changing the value of Unit to 2 would create a mount file that
 * would allow for QDOS floppies on DF2.
