Short:    Patched Qliberator runtimes
Type:     util/rext


These are the Qliberator runtimes, patched to some extent...
though I can't remember what I patched.

...probably removed TAS instructions for Amiga compatibility
...probably addressed 32bit addressing issues

Perhaps your own runtimes are newer and more appropriate.
