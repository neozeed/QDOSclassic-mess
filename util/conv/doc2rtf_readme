DOC2RTF is a utility that translates QUILL/XCHANGE '_DOC' files into
rich text format (.RTF).

Rich Text is a way of encoding documents using standard ASCII character
codes with ancillary formatting information added so the exact
appearance on a page is preserved even when the text is moved from one
package - or computer - to another. Rich Text is extensively used on
Apple Macintosh systems and is also recognised by workstations, Amiga
Wordworth 5 and many PC programs, including Microsoft Works and Word
for Windows.

DOC2RTF translates ALL the formatting characteristics of a QUILL
document including: bold, underline, tabs, margins, headers & footers.

PROGRAM FEATURES

* Translates ALL QUILL formatting features:
    (bold, underline, tabs, margins, headers, footers etc.)
* TURBO COMPILED for speed.
* BASIC source is provided.
* Task is patched to work on Minerva in two-screen mode.
    (TURBO tasks usually rely on the system variables being
    fixed at $28000.)
* Task is 32-bit compliant.
    (A lot of QL tasks have a 24-bit restriction so that they fail
    if you have more than 16mb of memory, or if QDOS is relocated
    such that SV.RAMTOP is greater than $1000000.)
* Task is CACHE friendly.
    (i.e. it will work on 68030, 68040 and 68060 processors.
    It will also work with COPYBACK enabled if your O/S supports it)
* The program is FREEWARE.


INSTRUCTIONS

Simply type 'EXEC DOC2RTF_task' to run the program. You will be asked
to provide input and output filenames. A progress bar is displayed as
the file is translated. Enter a null filename to quit the application.

                Also, Simon has ported the program to the Amiga.
                The Amiga version supports PC XCHANGE DOC files and is
                on the Aminet. The above explanation of the RTF file
                format is taken from his documentation.
