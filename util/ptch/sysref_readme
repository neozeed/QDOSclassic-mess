Short:    patch your progs to run when sys vars are relocated
Author:   Mark J Swift
Version:  1.10
Uploader: msw@blackpool.ac.uk
Type:     util/ptch


Many QL programs won't run when the system variables are
not located in the usual place ($28000 hex - 163840 decimal).
This can happen in Minerva with the second screen enabled or
in Amiga-QDOS running QDOS from extended memory.

This program takes a QL exectable, scans for $28XXX and
patches it apropriately.

PROGRAM FEATURES

* patches programs to run when sys vars are relocated
* makes all TURBO'ed & some QLIB'ed programs 32-bit clean
* CACHE friendly - patcher code will work on 68030, '40 and '60
  processors - will even work with COPYBACK enabled
* TURBO COMPILED for speed
* BASIC source is provided
* FREEWARE


PATCHING TURBO

If patching CODEGEN_task of the TURBO compiler, patch ALL
references EXCEPT the two that refer to $28010. These are not
part of the CODEGEN code, but ARE included in all TURBO
compiled programs. Patched versions of TURBO produce code
identical to unpatched versions, i.e. newly compiled tasks still
require patching.  If patching PARSER_task, or any other TURBO
program replace ALL references.


32 BIT FRIENDLY

SYSREF makes all TURBO'ed programs 32-bit clean. This means you
can run them high in memory. This is especially useful in
Amiga-QDOS, where if you have 16 meg of memory, the memory map
could be from $07000000 - $08000000 with the system variables
relocated to $07000000.


CACHE FRIENDLY

On a QL with a big processor (68030/'040/'060) the caches are
flushed/disabled/enabled at the appropriate time.


REQUIRES

Requires the D68K toolkit and some TK2 commands. If you don't have TK2
use PDTK instead which is FREEWARE.
