WHY IS IT NECESSARY?

Amiga hardware does not allow the CPU two contiguous bus cycles,
so any read/modify/write cycle is dammed to fail. As a result,
the TAS instruction doesn't work and can even mess up the next
instruction fetch, causing privilege violations and illegal
instructions


THE PATCHER PROGRAMS

* TASremove *

In recognised TURBO'ed and QLIB'ed tasks, this program replaces
TAS with equivalent QL-compatible code. If the code is not
recognised, TAS is replaced by a Line-A instruction (which is
programmed to emulate TAS but is not QL-compatible) or by extending
the code.

FIXES FOR QLIBERATOR

The Q_Liberator runtime libraries contain a single TAS instruction
TAS $8F(A6) in v3.22 and TAS $8F(A4) in the the budget compiler.
As a result any program compiled to include libraries will also
contain this instruction.

TASremove automatically recognises QLIB'ed tasks, removes the TAS
instruction and substitutes equivalent code that is compatible
with both a 'real' QL and Amiga-QDOS.

FIXES FOR TURBO COMPILER

The TURBO compiler package contains a single TAS $8F(A6) in
PARSER_task and two TAS instructions ( TAS $8F(a6) and
TAS $17(a2) ) in CODEGEN_task. Any program compiled with TURBO
may also contain these instructions.

TASremove automatically recognises TURBO'ed tasks, removes the TAS
instructions and substitutes equivalent code that is compatible
with both a 'real' QL and Amiga-QDOS.

FIXES FOR NON QLIB/TURBO CODE

If the file is not recognisable as either QLIB or TURBO code,
TASremove will produce a disassembly for every TAS found and will
ask you whether or not to replace the instruction. The program
may however, display TAS instructions where none are present.
A good rule-of-thumb is that true CODE will be surrounded by
other machine code instructions, whereas DATA will be liberally
sprinkled with DC.Ws

If the file is less than 32K, TASremove will replace TAS instructions
with a BSR to code that is tagged onto the end of the file. The
result is code that is compatible with both Amiga-QDOS and a 'real'
QL

If the file is bigger than 32K, TAS instructions are replaced
by a Line-A instruction (which is programmed to emulate TAS).
Line-A code is INCOMPATIBLE with a 'real' QL. Code modified in
this way will cause a total system crash if run on a real QL


* TASrestore *

Use this program to 'put-back' TAS instructions into programs
that have been altered by TASremove.
