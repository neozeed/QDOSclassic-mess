COMPATIBILITY

Works with the versions of QPAC2 that I have tried.


WHY IS IT NECESSARY?

HOT_rext (part of the QPAC2 package) expects the THING list
to be empty when it is initialised. However this is not the
case since QDOS classic makes extensive use of the THING
list for its own internal variables.

The example BOOT program temporarily dislocates the THING list
while HOT_REXT loads. After HOT_rext is loaded, the THING list
is restored.

QDOS classic continues to work while the THING list is dislocated
because if it doesn't find what it wants in the THING list, it
will search the COMMON HEAP instead. However this takes time
so things will S-L-O-W D-O-W-N. Restoring the THING list will
bring the system back up to speed.
